Suppose we have one infected individual and one susceptible individual. Infected individual makes effective contact at a constant rate $\beta$ and has a constant recovery rate of $\lambda$. Then, we can write the probability that the susceptible remains uninfected at time $t$ as follows:

$$
s(\tau)= \exp(-\beta \int_{t = 0}^\tau \exp(-\lambda t) dt)
$$

Solving the integral, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
s(\tau) = \exp\left(-\frac{\beta}{\lambda} (1 - \exp(-\lambda \tau)) \right)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Define $K(\tau) = F(\tau) \beta$ as the rate of secondary case, where $F(\tau) = \exp(-\lambda \tau)$ is the probability that an infectious individual has not recovered $t$ time units after infection.

We define network generation interval as follows:

$$
g(\tau) = \frac{K(\tau)s(\tau)}{\int_0^\infty K(\tau)s(\tau)d\tau}
$$

which can be simplified into

$$
g(\tau) = \frac{F(\tau)s(\tau)}{\int_0^\infty F(\tau)s(\tau)d\tau}
$$

Let's try to solve the integral... First, let's do substitution: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
dF &= -\lambda \exp(-\lambda \tau) d\tau\\
&= -\lambda F d\tau
\end{aligned}
$$

Substitute it:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\quad \int_0^\infty F(\tau) s(\tau) d\tau\\
&= -\frac{1}{\lambda} \int_1^0 \exp(-\frac{\beta}{\lambda} (1 - F)) dF\\
&= \frac{1}{\beta} \left[\exp(-\frac{\beta}{\lambda} (1 - F)) \right]_0^1\\
&= \frac{1}{\beta} \left(1 - \exp(-\frac{\beta}{\lambda}) \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the generation interval is

$$
g(\tau) = \beta \left(1 - \exp(-\frac{\beta}{\lambda}) \right)^{-1} \exp(-\lambda \tau) \exp\left(-\frac{\beta}{\lambda} (1 - \exp(-\lambda \tau)) \right)
$$

Comparison of intrinsic generation with network generation distribution for SIR model:

```{r network gen, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, echo=FALSE}
F <- function(t, lambda){
    exp(-lambda * t)
}

intrinsic.gen <- function(t, lambda){
    lambda * F(t, lambda)
}

network.gen <- function(t, beta, lambda){
    beta * (1 - exp(-beta/lambda))^(-1) * F(t, lambda) *
        exp(-beta/lambda * (1 - F(t, lambda)))
}

t <- seq(0, 5, 0.01)

plot(t, intrinsic.gen(t, 1), type = "l", col = "blue",
     ylab = "",
     xlab = "Time since infection")

for(i in 1:3){
    m <- 0.2 * 5^(i-1)
    lines(t, network.gen(t, m, 1), lty = i + 1)
}

arrows(1.5, 0.2, 1.1, 0.08, col = "red")
```

As we increase effective transmission rate, network generation follows the red arrow. Let's try to write a general equation...
